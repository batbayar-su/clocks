A simple app to keep track o time spent on projects, built using AngularJS and CodeIgniter

The goal of this project was to create a time-tracking app that anyone could download and spin up on their server or localhost LAMP stack.  It's still in development, so for the time being it's best to wait until it's done.

###Development###

This project uses AngularJS to act as the front-end view-controller, and CodeIgniter to act as the back-end model-controller.  It's built in Boostrap 3 to speed up development.

###Target Features###
* store and track time spent on various projects
* add sub-tasks to projects with their own timelines
* set target times for each project and task, with feedback when nearing and passing target times
* set project rates and print or email invoices
